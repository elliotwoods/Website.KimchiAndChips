                        Kimchi and Chips is a Seoul based art and design studio founded by Elliot Woods (UK) and Mimi Son (South Korea). They are known for discovering novel interactions involving people and media materials, discovering new technical and artistic paradigms.

                    <p>
                        They formed in 2009 to combine the disciplines of code, form, material, concept and mechanism. They create installations and dialogues which have been exhibited on four continents.

                    <p>
                        They create an emulsion of imagined reality within our physical world, in order to develop natural interactions between people, nature and the possibilities of the digital network.

                    <p>
                        Elliot Woods is a digital media artist, technologist, curator, educator from Manchester UK. He creates provocations towards future interactions between humans and socio-visual design technologies (principally projectors, cameras and graphical computation). Towards this goal, Elliot co-founded Kimchi and Chips, an experimental art / design / technology studio based in Seoul. He is known for transforming a tree into an addressable array of voxels and for throwing augmented fireballs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He is a curator of the ScreenLab Residency and ScreenLab Conference programmes, which develop digital media arts practice, and encourage the dialogue between digital and contemporary art cultures.
                    </p>
                        He applies his academic background in physics to produce sense-able interfaces with abstract systems, whilst applying a methodical approach to artistic enquiry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Elliot is a contributor to the openFrameworks project (a ubiquitous toolkit for creative coding), and an open source contributor to the VVVV platform. His code is available open source and for free on GitHub.
