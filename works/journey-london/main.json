	"description": ["We have designed a series of interactive lights created from raw materials people may encounter in their everyday lives - such as a box or papers or water. We find it intriguing to explore the use of emotion and humour in design as well as playing with technology. We are always looking for themes and materials from my everyday environment, then trying to distort their original function, with the aim of creating new stories and new technologies.",
					"We are attracted to cryptic puzzles and narrative snippets involving interactions. We have chosen a box and a little miniature city as the focus of my project. Opening the box and looking into the city will, I hope, evoke personal memories and narratives."],
