16,000 x 2,500 x 10,000 WHD

A second edition of the 483 Lines work commissioned by the ACT Festival, Gwangju 2015. Using Kevlar rope with 5000kg of tension, each string element becomes a high contrast infinitesimal white streak within a darkened space, each highly parallel to each other creating one dimensional moire phenomena.

As with the previous edition, projection is used to address each line with visual content, allowing for visual mass to be constructed from highlighted regions within the volume of string.
