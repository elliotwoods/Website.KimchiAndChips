	"description": ["A Journey: Seoul continues in the Journey series, looking into ways that people can build up their personal journey box using their own memories.",
	"The artists are interested in ways that people can store their memories inside of a box, and how they animate and add details to those objects. The scenes are non-specific, so that the user has space to add their own imagination to the box. The user can build up a scene that represents their private journey by selecting and arranging slides in the box. Each slide has a unique identity that is communicated to the box by a set of teeth on the bottom of the slide. The box can then respond by painting light and animation onto the slides using a projector overhead.",
	"The next stage in development is to enable people to draw their own slides. In this way, they can represent memories that are specific to themselves. They will also be able to add ambient sounds that they associate with that place.",
