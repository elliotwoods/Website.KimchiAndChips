	"description": ["Litescape is a 3D projection system based on the original Wiremap project by Albert Hwang. It allows motion graphics and visual information to be represented physically, occupying real world measurable space that is shared with the viewers. The project was realised so that we can develop new types of visual artwork and allow digital graphics to be more tangible and immersive.",
	"Unlike lenticular, parallax barrier or glasses based 3D screens which create a 3D effect using 2D images, Litescape builds the image using an array of 3D pixels in the real world."],
