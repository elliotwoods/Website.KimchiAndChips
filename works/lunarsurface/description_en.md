A vertical flag of fabric is stroked by the wind, displaced by curves of air, swinging back and forth. 
As it sweeps, it leaves a trail of light which draws a heavy fragile moon floating in space. 
The flag renders this moon from another reality, the silk surface acting as an intermediating manifold between reality and virtuality.

The artists worked within the concrete chambers of Bucheon city Incinerator, a stagnant industrial processing plant decommissioned in 2010. 
Breathing over 50 tonnes of new air into the building, the artists create a wind which blows a 20 meter flag of silk which is activated by digital light. 
This process renders a virgin moon into the post-industrial cavern.

At locations within the building, the artists collaborated with photographer Eunyoung Kim to capture moments of the moon being birthed. 
Long exposure photography trades the dimension of time for a dimension of space, extruding the moon into existence on a set of photographic prints, capturing a painting enacted by the details of the wind.
