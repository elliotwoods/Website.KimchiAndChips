	"description": ["Kimchi and Chips create phantoms of light in the air, crossing millions of calibrated beams with their work Light Barrier, 2014. The light installation creates floating graphic objects which animate through space as they do through time.",
	"A fascination with natural light drove the technique of the impressionist painters, they explored new qualities of colour and the trail of time. Kimchi and Chips' study of digital light discusses a new visual mechanic, their installation adding to the visual language of space and light. As the artist's inquiry deepens, brush strokes become descriptive like code, detailing reality and allying light with canvas.",
	"The Light Barrier is the universal law which seperates light and material. Both by limiting the actions of materials so that they cannot move like light, and by defining Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula.",
	"Light Barrier was co-commissioned by FutureEverything and the British Council. It premiered at New Media Night Festival, Nikola-Lenivets 4–6 June 2014.",
