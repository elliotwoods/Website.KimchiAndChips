The title references Deleuze’s thesis ‘Difference and Repetition’ - his attempt to understand reality without referring to identities. 

The artists aim to ‘unidentify’ the audience - to criticise the bubbles of reality which technology has helped us to build around ourselves. By allowing ourselves to remove our identity occasionally, we can better understand the thoughts of those we disagree with and therefore better work together to build a combined reality. 

Difference (in both senses) is generated by the motion control system which continuously changes the pose of the mirrors relative to the viewer. This movement disrupts space itself, creating a transformation similar to that of a Lorentz transformation when one travels close to the speed of light. This causes space itself to compress, twist and break, giving the viewer a tool for observing the non-absolute nature of time.

Once the viewers are standing in the area between the mirrors, they observe a sequence of motion which is designed around their perspective. They will see themselves multiply and divide, and will experience a kinaesthetic experience where they feel the shape of space and their own bodies shifting around them.
