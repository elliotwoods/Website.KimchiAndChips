	"description": ["Kimchi and Chips' new work commissioned by <a href=\"http://strp.nl/en/\" target=\"_blank\">STRP Festival</a> continues the work of the original <a href=\"http://www.kimchiandchips.com/works.html#lightbarrier\" target=\"_blank\">「Light Barrier, 2014」</a> into a new story with new physical techniques.",
	"The physical installation is presented with a heightened intensity, creating colour and contrast against the ephemeral white light projections. The light travels with scale and control to create determined objects of light within the air, further opening a window onto a semi-material reality.",
	"The physical-graphic story follows the journey of a digital form. By passing through the Light Barrier, the digital form transcends the limits of its home reality and passes into a physical one. It explores the possibilities of its new found physicality, whilst attempting to assert its digital identity. Finally the physical form then travels through the Light Barrier again to pass away to the next reality.",
