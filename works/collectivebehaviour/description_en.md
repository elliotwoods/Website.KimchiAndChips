Is my behaviour caused by my will? Can a collective of people exist without shared norms? Can individuals exist without relationships with others?

Collective Behaviour is a performance illustrating the symmetry between individual identity and collective identification. Reflective materials on the stage intervene the light, causing manipulations in space, time and the dancer’s individuality. The artists use projections and reflections to distort space, expanding it infinitely,  duplicating it, isolating it, and with this changing of space, consequently stretch and bend time within the performance. 

Dancers move independently in the space around the optical objects, whilst also the dancers become objects of the light and mirrors. They encounter undetermined images of themselves and others, creating accidental connections and determined relationships within the choreography. 

Collective Behaviour is a collaboration between Korean artists Kimchi and Chips and Danish choreographer Simone Wierød premiering in KPH Volume on 18th, 19th December 2019.  The project is supported by the Arts Council Korea (ARKO), STATENS KUNSTFOND, BIKUBENFONDEN, Københavnermærket and Seoul Dance Center.
