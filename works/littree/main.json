	"summary": "A conversation between a tree and people using 3D light patterns using the tree's leaves as voxels.",
	"description": ["A small potted tree is augmented with video projection, creating volumetric light patterns using itʼs own leaves as voxels. This technique allows a tree to have a visceral conversation with human visitors, and to become a new type of aesthetic object.",
	"The tree that can display digital media’ is a provocation against a current asymptote of outdoor digital media that champions media facades, we instead suggest interventions in reaction to existing unscripted entities within the environment such as trees.",
	"The projection triggers photosynthesis effects which affect tree growth, suggesting the possibility of 3D printing a tree, and of visitors feeding the tree through interaction with it.",
	"Lit Tree uses structured light projection techniques developed by Kimchi and Chips which they have made available online for free."],
