	"description": ["A vertical flag of fabric is stroked by the wind, displaced by curves of air pressure, swinging back and forth. As it sweeps, it extrudes a trail of light which draws a moon from an another reality.  The flag is a gateway between 2 realms and an intermediary between 2 laws of reality.",
	"Inspired by the 2 moons of Haruki Murakami's 1Q84 and the Lunar Flags of NASA, the artists present a portal into another domain, where another moon exists. This other place is made mortal by the fabric of the flag, a boundary between different worlds plays across its surface.",
	"Long exposure photography trades the dimension of time for a dimension of space, extruding the moon into existence on a set of photographic prints, the technology capturing a painting, enacted by the details of the wind.",
	"Lunar Flag begins a new line of enquiry for drawing into the air for studio Kimchi and Chips, forming artistic collaborations between technology and nature."],
